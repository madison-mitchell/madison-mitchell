# a little bit about myself...

Hi! My name is **Madison**. 👋🏻. I have a passion for creating, design, and fixing. What I love about Software Development is how it encapsulates all three in one. 
  
As an avid reader, particularly fantasy novels, and I enjoy working on side projects to continue to challenge myself as well as create handy products around the house, like a smart mirror that tells the time, current events and weather updates. And when I'm not indoors, my husband and I can be found around the national parks on our Honda Groms taking photos.
