# a little bit about myself...

Hi! My name is **Madison** üëãüèª. As a highly motivated Software Developer with 10 years experience working in the Technology Industry I'm currently working for a Fortune 500 Tech Company as a four-consecutive-year Triple Exceeding Expectations Tech Advisor. I'm dedicated to producing high quality products and results, naturally curious with a strong desire to grow skill set, and I excel in resolving challenges encountered in the workplace with innovative solutions and passionate about creating high quality, creative products.  
  
As an avid reader, particularly fantasy novels, and I enjoy working on side projects to continue to challenge myself as well as create handy products around the house, like a smart mirror that tells the time, current events and weather updates.
